# Android
- Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. It is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is based on the Linux kernel and is open-source, meaning that its source code is freely available to developers and users.

- Android allows developers to create applications using Java or Kotlin programming languages, and it provides a large number of tools and libraries to help developers create high-quality, feature-rich applications. Android applications can be downloaded from the Google Play Store or other third-party app stores, and they can also be sideloaded onto Android devices.

- In addition to smartphones and tablets, Android is used in a variety of other devices such as smartwatches, TVs, and cars. Android has also been used in specialized applications such as medical devices and industrial control systems.
